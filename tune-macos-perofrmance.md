# macOS Performance Tuning Script for AI/ML Developers - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a macOS performance tuning script specifically designed for AI/ML developers. The goal is to optimize macOS for demanding AI/ML workloads, ensuring maximum performance, stability, and an efficient development environment. This script will automate various system adjustments, freeing developers to focus on their core tasks.

## 2. Target Audience

The primary target audience for this script is AI/ML developers who use macOS as their primary development machine. These users typically:
- Work with large datasets and complex models.
- Utilize resource-intensive applications (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, Jupyter notebooks, Docker, VS Code).
- Require high computational throughput and low latency.
- Value system stability and a streamlined workflow.

## 3. Goals

The main goals of this performance tuning script are:
- **Maximize System Performance:** Optimize CPU, GPU, memory, and storage utilization for AI/ML tasks.
- **Enhance Development Workflow:** Reduce compilation times, improve application responsiveness, and minimize system bottlenecks.
- **Improve Stability:** Ensure the system remains stable under heavy loads.
- **Automate Optimization:** Provide an easy-to-use script that automates complex system configurations.
- **Reversibility:** Allow users to revert changes made by the script if necessary.

## 4. Key Features/Functionality

The script should include, but not be limited to, the following features:

### 4.1. Core System Optimizations
- **CPU Management:**
    - Disable unnecessary background processes and services (e.g., Time Machine local snapshots).
    - Adjust CPU scheduling priorities for AI/ML applications (recommendations for `nice`/`renice`).
- **Memory Management:**
    - Optimize swap usage and memory compression settings (e.g., `purge`, guidance on `vm.swapfile_max_size`, and explanation of memory compression).
    - Clear inactive memory and purge caches.
- **GPU Optimization (for Apple Silicon):**
    - Ensure optimal GPU driver settings (guidance on Metal Performance Shaders utilization).
    - Prioritize GPU resources for AI/ML frameworks (recommendations for monitoring tools like Activity Monitor, `powermetrics`).
- **Storage Optimization:**
    - Disable Spotlight indexing for development directories (manual configuration guidance).
    - Optimize file system settings (e.g., `noatime` for frequently accessed data).
    - Clear temporary files and logs.

### 4.2. Network Optimizations
- **DNS Caching:** Optimize DNS resolution settings by increasing cache time and size.
- **Network Buffer Tuning:** Adjust TCP/IP buffer sizes for high-throughput data transfers.

### 4.3. Developer Tooling Integration
- **Python Environment Optimization:**
    - Recommend or configure virtual environments (e.g., `conda`, `venv`).
    - Optimize `pip` or `conda` cache settings (e.g., `pip cache purge`, `conda clean --all`).
    - Guidance on setting `OMP_NUM_THREADS` for CPU-bound libraries.
- **Docker Optimization:**
    - Configure Docker Desktop resource limits (CPU, memory, disk).
    - Optimize Docker daemon settings for performance.
- **VS Code Optimization:**
    - Recommend extensions for performance monitoring.
    - Adjust VS Code settings for large file handling and resource usage.
- **Resource Allocation for ML Tasks:**
    - Guidance on using `nice` and `renice` to adjust process priorities for ML workloads.

### 4.4. User Interface & Experience
- **Animation Reduction:** Disable or reduce UI animations (e.g., `toggle_animations.sh` functionality).
- **Notification Management:** Minimize disruptive notifications during active development.

### 4.5. System Maintenance & Cleanup
- **Automated Cleanup:** Schedule or provide options for regular system cleanup (e.g., old logs, caches).
- **Disk Space Monitoring:** Alert users about low disk space in critical development partitions.

### 4.6. Safety and Control Features
- **User Confirmation:** Prompt for user confirmation before applying any system-level changes.
- **Backup:** Create a backup of current macOS defaults settings before making modifications.
- **Restore:** Provide an option to restore macOS settings from a previously created backup.

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** The script must significantly improve the performance of AI/ML workloads (e.g., 10-20% reduction in training times, faster data loading).
- **Security:** All changes must adhere to macOS security best practices and not introduce vulnerabilities.
- **Usability:** The script should be easy to run, with clear prompts and options for the user. It should provide feedback on changes made.
- **Compatibility:** The script must be compatible with the latest stable macOS versions (e.g., macOS Sonoma and future releases).
- **Idempotency:** Running the script multiple times should yield the same result without causing issues.
- **Logging:** All actions performed by the script should be logged for auditing and troubleshooting.

## 6. Scope

### 6.1. In Scope
- System-level optimizations for CPU, GPU, memory, and storage.
- Network tuning for development purposes.
- Integration and optimization recommendations for common AI/ML developer tools.
- UI/UX adjustments for a focused development environment.
- Reversibility of changes.
- User confirmation, backup, and restore functionalities.

### 6.2. Out of Scope
- Hardware upgrades or modifications.
- Deep-level kernel tuning that requires extensive system knowledge and could lead to instability.
- Optimization for non-AI/ML specific applications (unless they directly impact the development environment).
- Comprehensive security hardening beyond performance-related adjustments.

## 7. Future Considerations

- **GUI Interface:** Develop a graphical user interface for easier interaction.
- **Profile Management:** Allow users to save and load different optimization profiles (e.g., "training profile," "inference profile").
- **Telemetry:** Optional, anonymous telemetry to gather performance data and improve future versions.
- **Cross-Platform Support:** Explore extending optimizations to other operating systems (e.g., Linux for cloud instances).
- **AI-driven Optimization:** Implement machine learning to dynamically adjust settings based on real-time workload analysis.
